# SEAM_synchronizer
SEAM is a novel message synchronization policy designed to fuse data from different sensors in ROS2. This project integrates SEAM into the ROS2 framework and evaluates its effectiveness through a series of experiments, comparing it to traditional ROS2 synchronizers.

Features:

Message synchronization: SEAM enables seamless data fusion from multiple sensors within the ROS2 ecosystem.
Improved performance: SEAM aims to enhance synchronization efficiency and reduce latency compared to traditional ROS2 synchronizers.
Experimental evaluation: The project includes rigorous experiments to assess the effectiveness and performance of SEAM in real-world scenarios.
By incorporating SEAM into ROS2, this project explores an innovative approach to data fusion and synchronization, providing potential benefits in terms of accuracy, timeliness, and overall system performance.
